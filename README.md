# A-data-driven-framework-for-identification-of-hybrid-dynamical-systems

For each file, the codes in "generatedata" are used to generate data programed by MATLAB

the codes in "training" are used to train neural networks to approximate the subsystems and transition rules of hybrid systems, and can be opened by https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ or jupyter notebook
